Rocket-chat-OCP


Template for setting up Rocketchat in OCP

If you want to set up a backup routine for MongoDB, make sure to set a password/username that you know and not one that is auto-generated.

Might have to change proxy settings (Deployment, DC) on Rocket Chat if using corporate proxy.

TODO: Using a newer version of MongoDB as current one is deprecated.
